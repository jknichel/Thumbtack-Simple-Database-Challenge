# Thumbtack-Simple-Database-Challenge

This is my work to complete the Thumbtack Simple Data Base Challenge.

The main file is SimpleDB.py. To run, python SimpleDB.py. Start entering commands on the next line.
Valid commands can be found on the challenge page: https://www.thumbtack.com/challenges/simple-database

The tests directory has copies of all of the recommended tests from the challenge's webpage for easier testing. 
To run one of the tests, use python SimpleDB.py < tests/testX.txt.
